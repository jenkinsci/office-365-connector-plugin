  <p>
  If a build doesn't require access to desktop (only using command line tools and tests) this option can be checked.
  <p>
  This option allows Jenkins to configure the build process in headless mode 
  by adding <code>-Djava.awt.headless=true</code> to <code>MAVEN_OPTS</code>. 
  This is usefull on OSX to avoid Dock icons taking focus. This option may also in future releases be used to select adequate slave instance.
